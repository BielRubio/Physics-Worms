## Physics-Worms
This project is an assigment for the 2022-2023 Physics II class 2nd grade in CITM

## GAME
- Shot your adversary in this 1v1 turn based match in order to win

## CONTROLS
# Movement
- A: Move left
- D: Move right
- SCACE: Jump

# Gameplay
- E: Shot projectile
- Q: Shot remote controlled projectile
- ENTER: End turn

## MECHANICS
- Hit the target to multiply your damage x2
- Win if the oppenent HP reaches 0

## DEBUG KEYS
- F1: Change between different Integration methods
- F2: Toogle debug draw
- F3: Change between different Collision solving schemes
- F4: -1 FPS
- F5: +1 FPS
- F6: Change between 30 and 60 FPS
- F: Move target
- 1: Enable/Disable gravity force
- 2: Enable/Disable aerodynamics forces
- 3: Enable/Disable hydrodinamics forces
- 4: Enable/Disable friction force

## NOTES
- Debug draw hides everything because there are no textures
- The 'integration until theres no contact' collision solving method might get the program stuck on a while loop
